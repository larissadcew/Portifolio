## 👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Larissa!(WEB)


👨🏻‍💻 I have completed my studies at Harvard university.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning.
## Selected Experience

🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to mor the 50+projects a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a respective paper at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

### 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers

I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the ICLR Blogposts Track communicating the paper’s theory and my results.
